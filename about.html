	<p>Hyperknit aim is to consider knitting as a possible site of feminist practice. <br><br>Reading essays such as <i>Knitting as a Feminist Project?</i> by the American researcher Maura Kelly, and the discovery of the <i>Stitch 'n Bitch</i> groups, that offer safe spaces to knit and express progressive political engagement, were key in inspiring this project. 
	The revival of knitting as a popular hobby for both women and men seems to have become a way to allow the reappropriation of such a devalued and traditionally domestic feminine craft in a way that challenges gender norms by creating alternatives to the definition of feminine and masculine. 
	From these assumptions and the possibility of using knitting as a way of displaying data came the idea of finding a way to translate political engaged texts and books into knitting patterns, combining Morse code and the basic knitting stitches Knit and Purl.
	In the final pattern, there is also another layer of interpretation: the percentages of colours used in the garment reflect gender related data in different sectors and contexts in Italy.</p>
